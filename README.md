# ch7_animation_controller

A new Flutter project.

here we're trying to use an animation controller in flutter.

The animation can be played forward or reverse, and we can stop it.

For this, 
  add AnimationController
  Add Animation
  Iniate AnimationController with Duration
  Initiate animation with Tween with begin and end values and chain the animate method with a CurvedAnimation
  Use the AnimatedBuilder with Animation using Container with a balloon to start Animation by calling the 
    AnimationController.forward() and .reverse() to run the animation backward
  The AnimatedBuilder widget is used to create a widget that performs a reusable animation.
